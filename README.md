# Image classification with three machine learning models

In the notebook I build, train and compare three image classifiers:

* Regularized linear model
* K nearest neighbors algorithm (kNN)
* Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)

Data preparation and feature extraction are an essential part of training a machine learning model and the first half of the notebook regards these neccessary steps. All the classifiers are trained with cross validation and for kNN and linear model I also do feature selection.
